Very simple Python chat application handled with TCP. STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!

Currently works over the internet, just need to port forward a port

Run 1 application of the server

Run as many of the applications of the client as you want, send messages and hit enter. Other people can connect as well if your ports are open.
